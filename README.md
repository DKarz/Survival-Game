    <p>The game was made singlehandedly during the summer holidays. I used the Godot engine to
        create this shooter. If you have ever heard about game dev, you may ask why I chose Godot
        and not the "titans" of the industry, such as Unity and Unreal Engine. </p>
    <p>Before picking the engine, I conducted research regarding each of the engines. I found out
        that Godot is most modern among them, so many Unity devs have switched to it recently. The
        scripting language is another noteworthy factor. Godot uses GDScript that is a close
        relative to python - my favorite programming language.</p>
    <p>Even though there are some differences between these languages, I frequently forgot that I was not coding in
        python while working on the game. GDScript has extensive and comprehensive documentation, therefore I could
        quickly tackle the issues I had.</p>
    <p>After I finished the game (at least its alpha version), I realized the indie game dev is an extremely interesting
        and difficult hobby, especially for a beginner.</p>
    <p>The main aim of the player is to survive as many zombie waves as possible. It becomes more and more difficult to
        overcome each wave as zombi's stats as well as their amount rise. There is a 25-second break between each wave,
        during which the player can use the shop to top up the inventory. The arrow below points to the destination of
        the shop. </p>
